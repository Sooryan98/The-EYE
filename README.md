# The-EYE
Millions of people miss the joy of reading a book as they turned blind earlier on in their lives. Project EYE is aimed at enabling such blind people to regain the lost feeling of reading texts, pamphlets, flyers, etc.
The code mimics the functioning of a normal eye by processing the live video feed from the embedded camera and then once processing is finished any form of output can be given, in this case, the audio of the generated text is read out loud.
